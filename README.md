3d models and config files for our 3d printer

I purchased a Wanhao Duplicator i3 v2.1 (PowerSpec branded from MocroCenter). I am currently using TinkerCad for modeling, Cura for slicing, and OctoPrint for running the printer itself. I will add config files and profiles for the printer amd any models we decide to share.
